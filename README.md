# UIDetection Scientific Project
Framework that leverages modern computer vision technologies to analyze individual image fragments, recognize the systemâ€™s operational mode, and verify that all elements are correctly positioned. This framework will serve as the backbone for automated testing, enabling reliable and efficient validation of visual elements in various test scenarios.

## Installation Steps
1. Go sure you made the installation simple by using python 3.12.x otherwhise errors could appear and extra steps are necessary. On our build systems we had 7.0.0 and that worked with the additional steps in 4 also but as I mentioned is more work to do.

2. Install all necessary dependencies with:<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` if your python version is under 9.0 and/or an error appears on installing the requirements.txt (Cargo Rust Package Manager) jump to step. 4

2. If You have Internet skip this step! Otherwhise the OCR-Ai-model will not be automatically pulled. You have to put the EasyOCR into the User folder in Windows. For That copy the .EasyOCR folder and copy it to: C:\Users\username\
The path should then look like that: C:\Users\lhglij1\\.EasyOCR

3. Run script with: `python ui_detection.py` or `demo.py` to see how it works

4. Only do this if error on step 1. appear. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed with the extension: C++ Desktop developement with MSVC. This is needed for the following Rust distribution to prevent errors on compile. Watch the installation guide here: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html
Download the Rust-package manager .exe on: https://rustup.rs/ or if no internet download the offline-installer msvc (same 32/64bit version as your python interpreter) on https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html. Choose option 1. for standard installation and install the option for the current user with path-variables. for installing Visual Studio Desktop development with C++. Also when starting the Visual Studio installer make sure that package was installed successfully.
<br><br>
Try step. 1 again if problems continue here (normally with python versions 7.x.x):
<br><br>
OrderedDict import error: Go to pythonxx/lib/typing.py open and add following import on top:<br>`from collections import OrderedDict` 
<br><br>
urllib3 not found error (run following in terminal):
<br>
`pip uninstall urllib3`<br>
`pip install urllib3==1.26.7`<br>
<br>
start from step. 1 again
